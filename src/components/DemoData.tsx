Can you notify the QA team about some Jira issues that are ready for testing?
###
Entry type: human

USER_QUERY:
Can you notify the QA team about some Jira issues that are ready for testing?

ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT:
None
###
Entry type: ai

Thinking:
The user wants to notify the QA team about Jira issues that are ready for testing. Let me break this down according to my workflow:

1. Objective: Notify QA team about issues ready for testing
2. Context Sync: I need to gather current Jira issues and determine which ones are ready for testing
3. Constraints: Need to identify which issues are actually ready for QA
4. Validation: Ensure the issues I'm notifying about are properly ready
5. Hygiene: Clean identification of ready-for-testing issues
6. Alignment: Make sure the notification aligns with QA workflow
7. Delivery: Send appropriate notifications
8. Success Check: Verify the right issues are communicated

However, I'm missing some key information:
- Which specific Jira project/issues should I look at?
- What defines "ready for testing" (status criteria)?
- Which Slack channel should I notify (the user mentioned QA team but didn't specify a channel)?
- Should I search for issues in a specific project or across all projects?

According to my instructions, I should not make assumptions about missing critical parameters. I need to ask for clarification on:
1. Which Jira project or specific criteria to search for issues
2. What status indicates "ready for testing" 
3. Which Slack channel to notify

Let me ask for these clarifications first before proceeding.

I'd be happy to help notify the QA team about issues ready for testing! However, I need a few clarifications to ensure I provide the most accurate and useful notification:

## Missing Information:

1. **Jira Scope**: 
   - Which Jira project(s) should I search? (e.g., "WEBAPP", "API", etc.)
   - Or should I search across all projects?

2. **"Ready for Testing" Criteria**:
   - What status indicates issues are ready for QA? (e.g., "Ready for Testing", "In Review", "Development Complete")
   - Any other criteria like specific labels or components?

3. **Notification Channel**:
   - Which Slack channel should I post to? (e.g., #qa-team, #testing, #engineering)
   - If you're unsure, I can suggest some options after I find the issues

## My Approach:
Once you provide these details, I'll:
1. **Search Jira** for issues matching your criteria
2. **Validate** that each issue has proper acceptance criteria and is truly ready
3. **Create a structured summary** showing issue details, priorities, and any blockers
4. **Post to Slack** with direct links back to each Jira ticket for easy access

Could you please specify the project(s), status criteria, and target Slack channel?`;

export const sampleGeminiResponse = `I'll help you notify the QA team about Jira issues ready for testing. Let me search for issues with the appropriate status.

First, I need to understand your specific requirements:
- Which Jira project should I search?
- What status indicates "ready for testing"?
- Which Slack channel should I notify?

Once I have this information, I'll:
1. Search Jira for issues matching the criteria
2. Validate each issue has proper acceptance criteria
3. Create a summary and post to the specified Slack channel

Please provide the project name, status criteria, and target Slack channel.`;

export const sampleOpenAIResponse = `I'd be happy to help notify the QA team about issues ready for testing! Let me gather the necessary information and create a comprehensive notification.

## What I need from you:
1. **Jira Project**: Which project should I search?
2. **Status Criteria**: What status indicates "ready for testing"?
3. **Slack Channel**: Which channel should I post to?

## My process will be:
1. Search Jira for issues matching your criteria
2. Validate each issue has proper documentation
3. Create a structured summary
4. Post to Slack with direct links

Please provide the project details and I'll get started right away.`;
